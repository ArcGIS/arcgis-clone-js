### API Overview

#### Common terms

An ArcGIS Online (AGO) `item` is transformed into a `template` that contains all of its defining information. If the item depends on other items, those items are also transformed into templates.

A `Solution Item` can contain either

* a list of Item Templates
* a list of references to deployed items

When it contains Item Templates, it can be used for organizing and distributing Solutions, e.g., for displaying in a gallery of Solutions.

When a Solution is deployed into an organization, a new Solution is created that contains references to the items deployed into the organization; it serves as a table of contents for the deployment.

#### Packages

The API is divided into packages to make it easier to use just the parts that you want:

* `common`, which contains common helper functions for the other packages
* `creator`, which contains functions for transforming items into templates
* `deployer`, which contains functions for deploying item templates into items in a destination organization
* `feature-layer`, which contains functions for Feature Service items
* `file`, which contains functions for items that contain files
* `group`, which contains functions for Groups
* `simple-types`, which contains functions for the simpler item types Dashboard, Form, Web Map, Web Mapping Application, and Workforce Project
* `storymap`, which contains functions for Storymap items
* `viewer`, which contains functions to support displaying Solution items

#### Additional information

The API documentation is published at https://esri.github.io/solution.js/ ([source code](./docs/src)).

### Instructions

You can install dependencies by cloning the repository and running:

```
npm install
```

Afterward, for a list of all available commands run `npm run`.

Some useful commands include:

* building
  * `npm run build` creates symlinks among packages and creates node, umd, and esm outputs for each package
  * `npm run clean` runs `clean:src` and `clean:dist`
    * `npm run clean:src` deletes `.d.ts`, `.js`, and `.js.map` files
    * `npm run clean:dist` deletes `.rpt2_cache` and `dist` folders
  * `npm run lint` lints the TypeScript files
  * `npm run lint:fix` lints the TypeScript files and fixes
  * `npm run prettify` beautifies TypeScript files

* testing
  * `npm run test` lints, then runs tests `test:node` and `test:chrome` to confirm that the API is functioning as expected
  * `npm run test:chrome` runs karma in the Chrome browser
  * `npm run test:chrome:ci` runs karma in the ChromeHeadlessCI browser
  * `npm run test:chrome:debug` runs karma in the Chrome browser and leaves the browser open for debugging tests
  * `npm run test:firefox` runs karma in the Firefox browser
  * `npm run test:node` runs jasmine
  * `npm run test:node:debug` runs jasmine in debug mode
  * `npm run test:ci` lints, then runs `test:node`, `test:chrome:ci`, `test:firefox`, and `coveralls` from a bash window
  * `npm run test:ci:win` lints, then runs `test:node`, `test:chrome:ci`, `test:firefox`, and `coveralls:win` from a Windows window
  * `npm run test:all` runs `test:node` and `test:chrome`
  * `npm run coveralls` updates code coverage info from a bash window
  * `npm run coveralls:win` updates code coverage info from a Windows window

* publishing doc
  * `npm run docs:build` _(requires bash console)_
    * `npm run docs:typedoc`
    * `npm run docs:build:acetate`
    * `npm run docs:build:sass`

  * `npm run docs:deploy` runs `docs:build` and pushes the documentation to the repository's gh-pages
  * `npm run docs:srihash`

* publishing code _(requires bash window)_
  * `npm run prerelease:prepare` fetch, clean, link packages, and test
  * `npm run release:prepare` prepares for publication and creates a changelog
  * `npm run release:review` assembles git changes _(use arrow keys to put cursor on line_ above _desired version)_
