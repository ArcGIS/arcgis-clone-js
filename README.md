### API Overview

#### Common terms

An ArcGIS Online (AGO) `item` is transformed into a `template` that contains all of its defining information (except its thumbnail and resources; see [background info](./docs/Background.md)). If the item depends on other items, those items are also transformed into templates.

A `Solution Item` can contain either

* a list of Item Templates
* a list of references to deployed items

When it contains Item Templates, it can be used for organizing and distributing Solutions, e.g., for displaying in a gallery of Solutions.

When a Solution is deployed into an organization, a new Solution is created that contains references to the items deployed into the organization; it serves as a table of contents for the deployment.

#### Modules

The API contains two primary modules:

* `solution`, which contains functions for transforming items into templates, deploying item templates into items, and creating & using Solution Items.
* `viewing`, which contains functions to support displaying Solution Items.

#### Additional information

The API documentation is published at https://esri.github.io/solution.js/ ([source code](./docs/src)).

Background information about the library is available in [background info](./docs/Background.md)).
