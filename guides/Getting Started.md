## Building

1. Build the repository using the Windows batch file `build.bat` or the bash command shell `build.sh`. These files initialize the npm environment that the library uses, build the library and its demos, and run the unit tests.
2. On Windows, copy the demos folder into C:\inetpub\wwwroot\
3. On Windows, open a browser and go to the page http://localhost/demos

You'll see a list of demos that can be used to try out the solution.js library.

The demos are configured so that they're built using your environment rather than released versions of the solution.js packages. This makes it possible for you to demo your modifications to the library.
